	///
	/// # Description
	/// The `objectref` must be of type reference and must refer to an object that is an instance of class `java/lang/Throwable` or of a subclass of
	/// `java/lang/Throwable`. It is popped from the operand stack. The `objectref` is then thrown by searching the current method for the first exception
	/// handler that matches the class of `objectref`, as given by the algorithm in ยง2.10.
	///
	/// If an exception handler that matches `objectref` is found, it contains the location of the code intended to handle this exception. The `pc` register is
	/// reset to that location, the operand stack of the current frame is cleared, `objectref` is pushed back onto the operand stack, and execution continues.
	///
	/// If no matching exception handler is found in the current frame, that frame is popped. If the current frame represents an invocation of a synchronized
	/// method, the monitor entered or reentered on invocation of the method is exited as if by execution of a [Opcode::MonitorExit] instruction. Finally, the
	/// frame of its invoker is reinstated, if such a frame exists, and the `objectref` is rethrown. If no such frame exists, the current thread exits.
	///
	/// # Run-time Exception
	/// - If `objectref` is `null`, throw a `java.lang.NullPointerException` instead of `objectref.
	///
	/// Otherwise, if the Java Virtual Machine implementation does not enforce the rules on structured locking described in ยง2.11.10, then if the method of the
	/// current frame is a synchronized method and the current thread is not the owner of the monitor entered or reentered on invocation of the method,
	/// [Opcode::AThrow] throws an `java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException` instead of the object previously being thrown. This can happen, for example, if an
	/// abruptly completing synchronized method contains a [Opcode::MonitorExit] instruction, but no [Opcode::MonitorEnter] instruction, on the object on which
	/// the method is synchronized.
	///
	/// Otherwise, if the Java Virtual Machine implementation enforces the rules on structured locking described in ยง2.11.10 and if the first of those rules is
	/// violated during invocation of the current method, then [Opcode::AThrow] throws an `java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException` instead of the object
	/// previously being thrown.
	///
	/// # Notes
	/// The operand stack diagram for the [Opcode::AThrow] instruction may be misleading: If a handler for this exception is matched in the current method, the
	/// [Opcode::AThrow] instruction discards all the values on the operand stack, then pushes the thrown object onto the operand stack. However, if no handler
	/// is matched in the current method and the exception is thrown farther up the method invocation chain, then the operand stack of the method (if any) that
	/// handles the exception is cleared and `objectref` is pushed onto that empty operand stack. All intervening frames from the method that threw the
	/// exception up to, but not including, the method that handles the exception are discarded.

	/// of the current class (ยง2.6), where the value of the index is `(indexbyte1 << 8) | indexbyte2`. The run-time constant pool item at the index must be a

	/// If `objectref` is `null`, then the operand stack is unchanged.

	/// the operand stack is unchanged; otherwise, the `checkcast` instruction throws a `java/lang/ClassCastException`.
	///
	/// The following rules are used to determine whether an `objectref` that is not `null` can be cast to the resolved type: if `S` is the class of the object
	/// referred to by `objectref` and `T` is the resolved class, array, or interface type, `checkcast` determines whether `objectref` can be cast to type `T`
	/// as follows:
	/// - If `S` is an ordinary (nonarray) class, then:
	///   - If `T` is a class type, then `S` must be the same class as `T`, or `S` must be a subclass of `T`;
	///   - If `T` is an interface type, then `S` must implement interface `T`.
	/// - If `S` is an interface type, then:
	///   - If `T` is a class type, then `T` must be `java/lang/Object`.
	///   - If `T` is an interface type, then `T` must be the same interface as `S` or a superinterface of `S`.
	/// - If `S` is a class representing the array type `SC[]`, that is, an array of components of type `SC`, then:
	///   - If `T` is a class type, then `T` must be `java/lang/Object`.
	///   - If `T` is an interface type, then `T` must be one of the interfaces implemented by arrays (JLS ยง4.10.3).
	///   - If `T` is an array type `TC[]`, that is, an array of components of type `TC`, then one of the following must be true:
	///     - `TC` and `SC` are the same primitive type.
	///     - `TC` and `SC` are reference types, and type `SC` can be cast to `TC` by recursive application of these rules.

	/// # Description
	/// A [Opcode::LookupSwitch] is a variable-length instruction. Immediately after the [Opcode::LookupSwitch] opcode, between zero and three bytes must act
	/// as padding, such that `defaultbyte1` begins at an address that is a multiple of four bytes from the start of the current method (the opcode of its first
	/// instruction). Immediately after the padding follow a series of signed 32-bit values: `default`, `npairs`, and then `npairs` pairs of signed 32-bit
	/// values. The `npairs` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Each of the `npairs` pairs consists of an `int` match and a signed 32-bit offset. Each of
	/// these signed 32-bit values is constructed from four unsigned bytes as `(byte1 << 24) | (byte2 << 16) | (byte3 << 8) | byte4`.
	///
	/// The table match-offset pairs of the [Opcode::LookupSwitch] instruction must be sorted in increasing numerical order by match.
	///
	/// The `key` must be of type `int` and is popped from the operand stack. The `key` is compared against the match values. If it is equal to one of them,
	/// then a target address is calculated by adding the corresponding offset to the address of the opcode of this [Opcode::LookupSwitch] instruction. If the
	/// `key` does not match any of the match values, the target address is calculated by adding `default` to the address of the opcode of this
	/// [Opcode::LookupSwitch] instruction. Execution then continues at the target address.
	///
	/// The target address that can be calculated from the offset of each match-offset pair, as well as the one calculated from default, must be the address of
	/// an opcode of an instruction within the method that contains this [Opcode::LookupSwitch] instruction.
	///
	/// # Notes
	/// The alignment required of the 4-byte operands of the [Opcode::LookupSwitch] instruction guarantees 4-byte alignment of those operands if and only if
	/// the method that contains the [Opcode::LookupSwitch] is positioned on a 4-byte boundary.
	///
	/// The match-offset pairs are sorted to support lookup routines that are quicker than linear search.

	/// A [Opcode::TableSwitch] is a variable-length instruction. Immediately after the opcode, between zero and three bytes must act as padding, such that
	/// `defaultbyte1` begins at an address that is a multiple of four bytes from the start of the current method (the opcode of its first instruction).
	/// Immediately after the padding are bytes constituting three signed 32-bit values: `default`, `low`, and `high`. Immediately following are bytes
	/// constituting a series of `high - low + 1` signed 32-bit offsets. The value `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. The `high - low + 1` signed
	/// 32-bit offsets are treated as a 0-based jump table. Each of these signed 32-bit values is constructed as `(byte1 << 24) | (byte2 << 16) | (byte3 << 8)
	/// | byte4`.
	///
	/// The index must be of type int and is popped from the operand stack. If `index` is less than `low` or `index` is greater than `high`, then a target
	/// address is calculated by adding `default` to the address of the opcode of this [Opcode::TableSwitch] instruction. Otherwise, the offset at position
	/// `index - low` of the jump table is extracted. The target address is calculated by adding that offset to the address of the opcode of this
	/// [Opcode::TableSwitch] instruction. Execution then continues at the target address.
	///
	/// The target address that can be calculated from each jump table offset, as well as the one that can be calculated from `default`, must be the address
	/// of an opcode of an instruction within the method that contains this [Opcode::TableSwitch] instruction.

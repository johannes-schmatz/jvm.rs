	/// # Operand Stack
	/// ```
	/// ..., objectref: reference ->

	///
	/// # Description
	/// The `objectref` must be of type reference and must refer to an object that is an instance of class `java.lang.Throwable` or of a subclass of
	/// `java/lang/Throwable`. It is popped from the operand stack. The `objectref` is then thrown by searching the current method for the first exception
	/// handler that matches the class of `objectref`, as given by the algorithm in ยง2.10.
	///
	/// If an exception handler that matches `objectref` is found, it contains the location of the code intended to handle this exception. The `pc` register is
	/// reset to that location, the operand stack of the current frame is cleared, `objectref` is pushed back onto the operand stack, and execution continues.
	///
	/// If no matching exception handler is found in the current frame, that frame is popped. If the current frame represents an invocation of a synchronized
	/// method, the monitor entered or reentered on invocation of the method is exited as if by execution of a [Opcode::MonitorExit] instruction. Finally, the
	/// frame of its invoker is reinstated, if such a frame exists, and the `objectref` is rethrown. If no such frame exists, the current thread exits.
	///
	/// # Run-time Exception
	/// - If `objectref` is `null`, throw a `java.lang.NullPointerException` instead of `objectref.
	///
	/// Otherwise, if the Java Virtual Machine implementation does not enforce the rules on structured locking described in ยง2.11.10, then if the method of the
	/// current frame is a synchronized method and the current thread is not the owner of the monitor entered or reentered on invocation of the method,
	/// [Opcode::AThrow] throws an `java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException` instead of the object previously being thrown. This can happen, for example, if an
	/// abruptly completing synchronized method contains a [Opcode::MonitorExit] instruction, but no [Opcode::MonitorEnter] instruction, on the object on which
	/// the method is synchronized.
	///
	/// Otherwise, if the Java Virtual Machine implementation enforces the rules on structured locking described in ยง2.11.10 and if the first of those rules is
	/// violated during invocation of the current method, then [Opcode::AThrow] throws an `java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException` instead of the object
	/// previously being thrown.
	///
	/// # Notes
	/// The operand stack diagram for the [Opcode::AThrow] instruction may be misleading: If a handler for this exception is matched in the current method, the
	/// [Opcode::AThrow] instruction discards all the values on the operand stack, then pushes the thrown object onto the operand stack. However, if no handler
	/// is matched in the current method and the exception is thrown farther up the method invocation chain, then the operand stack of the method (if any) that
	/// handles the exception is cleared and `objectref` is pushed onto that empty operand stack. All intervening frames from the method that threw the
	/// exception up to, but not including, the method that handles the exception are discarded.

	/// # Description
	/// A [Opcode::TableSwitch] is a variable-length instruction. Immediately after the opcode, between zero and three bytes must act as padding, such that
	/// `defaultbyte1` begins at an address that is a multiple of four bytes from the start of the current method (the opcode of its first instruction).
	/// Immediately after the padding are bytes constituting three signed 32-bit values: `default`, `low`, and `high`. Immediately following are bytes
	/// constituting a series of `high - low + 1` signed 32-bit offsets. The value `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. The `high - low + 1` signed
	/// 32-bit offsets are treated as a 0-based jump table. Each of these signed 32-bit values is constructed as `(byte1 << 24) | (byte2 << 16) | (byte3 << 8)
	/// | byte4`.
	///
	/// The index must be of type int and is popped from the operand stack. If `index` is less than `low` or `index` is greater than `high`, then a target
	/// address is calculated by adding `default` to the address of the opcode of this [Opcode::TableSwitch] instruction. Otherwise, the offset at position
	/// `index - low` of the jump table is extracted. The target address is calculated by adding that offset to the address of the opcode of this
	/// [Opcode::TableSwitch] instruction. Execution then continues at the target address.
	///
	/// The target address that can be calculated from each jump table offset, as well as the one that can be calculated from `default`, must be the address
